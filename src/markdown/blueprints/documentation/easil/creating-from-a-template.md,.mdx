## Creating From a Template

### [Selecting a Template & Renaming It](https://educate.liferay.com/design-tool-easil/363494 "Selecting a Template & Renaming It")

Once you click on a template, it will open as a copy in your Workspace. If you close it (by clicking on the “E” logo in upper left), you’ll see that it’s located in your Workspace with the original file name. 

**Before you do anything else, make sure to rename your Design!** Navigate to the “Home” section (first tab in right panel), then click on the pencil icon. This will open a popup window with editable fields for Title and Subtitle.

We recommend the following naming convention, and that you put the same information for both Title and Subtitle.

**YY-Event or Region-Title of Project or H1-Post Platform-version#**

Examples: 

* 19-Devcon-Diamond Sponsors Confirmed-Email-v2
* 19-NA-Living with Humans Webinar-Tw-v1

**Pro Tip:** We DO NOT recommended using the other two buttons in the Home panel (Resize, Duplicate), as this will resize your backgrounds automatically. Instead, to create another image with different sizing, go back to Templates/Team and select from there each time.

Next, select the Page variation that best suits your needs.

**Pro Tip:** Delete any Pages you won’t be using (optional, but it helps to clean up your file and avoid confusion).
