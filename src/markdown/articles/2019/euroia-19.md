## The Workshops

The best value of this event are the workshops, so here’s the list of the ones we’ve attended to and a small recap of the experience we had. 

### Design for Worldview

[Amy Lazarus](https://euroia.org/person/amy-lazarus/) / [Hosan Lee](https://euroia.org/person/hosan-lee/)

This workshop was about the innate biases we all have as humans and how to identify them at both individual and team levels. 

We’ve worked divided in groups, talked about our design process with the group, the goal was to learn how to identify the possible hidden bias traps inside our work process, identify a pattern and receive advice on how to fight those biases.

### Understanding Users Through Natural Language Processing

[Aletta Smits](https://euroia.org/person/aletta-smits/) / [Erik Hekman](https://euroia.org/person/erik-hekman/)

We took the first steps into Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation using R-Studio. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a generative probabilistic model that relies on the clustering of similar terms and calculates the statistical probability that these terms belong together.

It was very inspiring! This technique combined with modern social networks theories can be very useful to segment users, find patterns and connections between clusters of users that behave using a similar language. As can be seen in the image, we found a group of users with political bounds!

### Designing digital places through container based information architecture and object-­first design

[Koen Peters](https://euroia.org/person/koen-peters/) / [Konstantin Weiss](https://euroia.org/person/konstantin-weiss/) / [Ben Lipinski](https://euroia.org/person/ben-lipinski/)

Container Based IA is closely related to other models and tools, like OOUX (Object-Oriented UX), the Core model and content modelling. The workshop explained how these models are related to the Container Based IA, and we learnt some practical methods to apply it.

### Rules! Drama! Action! – A game design approach to mapping, designing, and communicating experiences

[Andrea Resmini](https://euroia.org/person/andrea-resmini/)

Games, as any story, are based on structure and drama. Andrea taught us how to break down and conceptualize experiences, from both digital and physical spaces, and recreate a board game from them.

The goal was to see the games we were playing as complex systems and analyze how the users interacted with them. 

A common pattern we’ve seen was that the more rules (complexity) a game had, the more errors were made by playing it.

### Design at scale: from atomic research to evolving design systems in complex international platforms

[Alexandre Pawlak](http://2019.euroia.org/person/alexandre-pawlak/) / [Magdalena Rydiger](http://2019.euroia.org/person/magdalena-rydiger/) / [Noëlle Lewkowicz](http://2019.euroia.org/person/noelle-lewkowicz/) / [Matthias Mouy](http://2019.euroia.org/person/matthias-mouy/)

During the workshop we used a challenge: create an online marketplace for different tourism experiences in Riga. We worked on groups focusing on different data and trying to solve different aspects on the app.

![atomic research funnel](/images/posts/euroia-19/euroia19-atomic-research.png)

We used Atomic Research to face the challenge. We analysed the raw data (both qualitative and quantitative information they provided us), finding real facts among all the information, and turning those facts into insights, after that, we looked for possible solutions to those insights, and got to the conclusions. 

![table full of papers](/images/posts/euroia-19/euroia19-papers-table.png)

In this phase, we joined other teams to see if our conclusions were aligned, and we discovered that we were missing other relevant information that other teams had to handle while trying to solve other parts of the app. So, we understood the importance of keeping a research library available, transparent and easy to use to avoid information silos and have an aligned the whole vision of the product. 

It was very interesting to attend this workshop. The organization and problems the speakers had to face in their company are very similar to the challenges we have to face in Liferay, as we both are a multi region, cross-disciplinary teams working on the same product and trying to keep it coherent. To know how other companies face the same challenges is very enriching. 

### (Re)Shaping designers for the right impact

[Jason Mesut](http://2019.euroia.org/person/jason-mesut/)

This workshop was oriented to self discovery as designers. We performed a lot of exercises to map our current position and figure out next steps to reinforce our skills and became the better version of ourselves as designers.

### What kind of future do you want? Planning a preferable future

[Dan Ramsden](https://euroia.org/person/dan-ramsden/) / [North Kuras](https://euroia.org/person/north-kuras/) / [Vicky Holland](https://euroia.org/person/vicky-holland/) / [Emily Heath](https://euroia.org/person/emily-heath/) / [Rob Scott](https://euroia.org/person/rob-scott/)

First things first, I loved this workshop! I usually think about possible futures and how the world is going to be in 50 years. Realizing that it is possible to use it as a design technique, and being aware of the design implications  to choose the right decision and effectively affect the future made me happy.

During this workshop we performed different exercises to understand the theory they were explaining. The first one was a role play game in which each table was an island. Each of the islands had something special, such as teletransportation or poisonous water, so the table needed to decide how that new situation will affect the island and possible futures.

The second exercise was to predict and look for the preferable future. Starting by identifying trends in the news and trying to think about all possible impacts that trend could have regarding one domain. Then look for the next possible consequences of the consequences. We used a Future Wheel to do that, writing in the center of the wheel the selected trend and domain to write events or consequences in the next nodes.  

The next activity was the Future Cone where we placed one of the paths of the Future wheel and give each node and estimated time of arrival. And select the preferable future. Then think of the best way to get there among all the possible futures.

## The Talks

Along these three conference days, there were two tracks of talks. Our highlight in some of them are:

## The unintended consequences of our design choices

[Aly Blenkin](http://2019.euroia.org/person/aly-blenkin/) 

Technology is neutral? No, because it's human.

It’s important to understand the implications of our design decisions, and for that:

1. Understand the scale of the problem (rules, regulations, actors, motivations...)
2. Map it and get feedback.
3. Reflect and act. Identify gaps and design for a positive impact 

And reduce the negative impact:

1. Prompt speculations designing for the future
2. Create speeds bumps and use design principles
3. Identify your ethical principles.

### Citizen Centric Information Architecture: Creating a truly Citizen-Centric Digital Government

[Alysson Franklin](http://2019.euroia.org/person/alysson-franklin/)

Use case of redesign for Ohio government. 

Problems to face: who owns the data and sources and information overload, which ended in the lack of trust of the employees, because it is difficult to manage the portal and also the citizens.

6 challenges:

1. De-bureaucratize the authoring layer
2. Turn content tagging an easy task
3. Unify UX and interaction patterns
4. Catalog all info and remove duplicity
5. Rock-solid, yet scalable data model
6. Design for all cultures and societies in Ohio

How did they do it? Using “A pattern language”. By identifying global patterns, selecting the main ones, providing a structure and taxonomy and allowing the users to create their own taxonomy too (folksonomie)

As a curious thing, This solution was made using Liferay ❤️.

### It’s Not Simple, Stupid! Dealing with Complex Systems and Wicked Problems

[Hertje Brodersen](http://2019.euroia.org/person/hertje-brodersen/)
 
We learned how to identify wicked problems and how to deal with them as well as complex systems:

1. Context. Recognising complexity. “Disasters occur when a complex issue is managed as a complicated or simple one”
Determine the type of problem (Simple = Bake a cake, Complicated = Build a Rocket, Complex = Raise a child), acknowledge wicked problems, make time to deal with complexity, don’t use formulaic solutions, act, take responsibility.
2. Planning. Ask tough questions, be realistic and pragmatic, practice critical thinking.
3. Mindset. Designing for complexity. “It is your job to make others (and yourself) uncomfortable.” Solve for problems, not tools, learn to live with uncertainty, don’t get too comfortable.

### Let’s Destroy Silicon Valley

[Mike Monteiro](http://2019.euroia.org/person/mike-monteiro/)

I have to say that Mike is a very good speaker. He talked with passion and energy because we even heard the cracks of the lectern. However, we felt at some moments out of context like if we were in a political speech. He talked about ethics and morals with cases from Silicon Valley. But, in Europe or Spain with our laws most of those cases would never have existed.

### A hard look in the mirror: language, structure, and privilege in IA

[Lara Portmann](http://2019.euroia.org/person/lara-portmann/)

Very interesting approach on how language can influence people. “The words we use have consequences. Language shapes reality”.

And about the privileges. It is important to be aware and recognize, assess and change to include all the people in our designs.

- Who is (not) included?
- What can they (not) do?
- How are other people/actions excluded?
- Why are they excluded? (gender, race, social class, age, disability, sexual orientation ethnicity...)
- What should I change?
- What can I change NOW? 

### A taxonomy of the orcanization – game design for information architecture

[Andrea Resmini](http://2019.euroia.org/person/andrea-resmini/)

This talk was an introduction for the workshop he was giving the next day. Andrea compared both digital/physical games, and applications to complex systems showing that they have some common points in the narrative and experiences.

He used digital games such as Prince of Persia and Shadow of Mordor, but also physical games such as Chess and Tic Tac Toe.

 
### Lessons from a Jazz Musician: Improvisation in Research

[Rachel Price](http://2019.euroia.org/person/rachel-price/)

What Rachel did was actually very impressive. 
For the first half of the talk she explained the role of the research facilitator as any other talk out there. In the second half she talked about Jazz and improvisation methods, then she divided the entire public into 3 big groups and got them to clap their hands separately.

![graphic of the future](/images/posts/euroia-19/euroia19-embellistments.png)

It was really fun to be part of this, it was also really interesting to see how she transformed from a speaker to a facilitator that was directing and improvising with the public.

## Conclusion

### Pros

- It was a great event where we had the opportunity to learn techniques and wider points of view  that we can apply to our daily work.
- The workshops were highly valuable.
- We interacted and connected with a lot of designers. We’ve even met a Liferay partner and ended up talking about their projects, our features and how they use our products.
- Ethics were a huge part of this event and it’s always great to have a refresh of what can go wrong with your work and the impact it can have in others lives.

### Cons

- Ethics was present in several talks and, although we consider it very important, it was too much for us.
