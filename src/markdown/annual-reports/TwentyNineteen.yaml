title: Annual Report
subtitle: This was a big year for design at Liferay. We continued to scale, moving designers from Product Management, Marketing, and Engineering to form a Design department at Liferay. Our second annual report shares highlights about our organization, the work we've done for customers, our local communities, and the design community at large.

    content:
        While we recognize that there are differences in each team’s skills, there are also similarities in what makes a “designer” of any profession, a designer. As a department, we want to steward and attract designers that add to Liferay’s culture.
        The Design Department is comprised of three teams; Communication, Product, and Research. Each of those teams determines the skills required to be a designer on that team. These skills should be relevant to the market and also reflect the ways in which we’re adding value to the company.

    subtitle: We recognize that not everyone wants to manage people — and that's great — we need to ensure there’s room for all to grow. We have designed a dual-track path, one for people management and one for individual contribution.

    title: Underground Writing
    subtitle:
        This year Design for Life(ray) served Underground Writing, an organization that runs creative workshops that empowers personal transformation in migrant, incarcerated, recovery, and other at-risk communities through literacy.

        Liferay designers spent some time at the end of the year to give Underground Writing a top to down make-over. This included a brand new website, completely revamped tech stack, and service design optimizations.
